paasbox is a lightweight PaaS environment for local development of microservices and other 12-factor apps.

It simulates environments like [Mesos](https://mesos.apache.org/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/),
[CloudFoundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) or [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/), and provides a
web UI to help eliminate 'console window hell'.

See the [getting started guide]({{< relref "getting-started/index.md" >}}) for instructions how to get
it up and running.
